Front Matter is an integral Visual Studio Code extension that simplifies operating and managing your markdown articles. We created the extension to support several static-site generators and frameworks parallel to Hugo, Jekyll, Hexo, NextJs, Gatsby, and more which provides you the power and control of a full-blown Content Management System (CMS).

The extension brings CMS capabilities straight to Visual Studio Code. For example, you can keep a list of the used tags, categories, create content, and so much more.
